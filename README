DESCRIPTION

        Lastfm API library writen in Python. Iplements Lastfm API methods 
    as described in its [documentation](http://www.last.fm/api). 

USAGE

    . Authentication

        1. Get user authentication

            from lastfm.src.auth import Auth

            # Creates an Auth object not authenticated
            auth = Auth()
            # generate and returns the url tha you have redirect the 
            # user to give permission to your application
            auth_url = auth.get_auth_url()

            # if the user user give permission to your application, you can
            # retrieves his session key
            session = auth.get_session()

            # You should store this session variable. It will be used to 
            # compose all the authenticated requests to the Last FM API


        2. User already authenticated

            from lastfm.src.auth import Auth

            # Creates an Auth object authenticated
            stored_session = "19c246aa7ebf5d60ezdv6ae33d5c9d0x"
            auth = Auth(stored_session)

    . Requests

        1. Get an artist full information

            from lastfm.src.artist import Artist

            # Creates an Artist object by its name
            artist = Artist("the strokes")

            # retrieves artist information
            info = artist.get_info()


    . Authenticated Requests

        1. Gets an Artist tags from user

            from lastfm.src.auth import Auth
            from lastfm.src.artist import Artist

            auth = Auth(stored_session)
            artist = Artist("the strokes")

            # every authenticated requests you should pass your Auth object 
            # than the library makes the magic for you signing the request
            tags = artist.get_tags(auth=auth)


DEVELOPMENT STATUS
        The current Library only implements the Artists methods from the
    Last FM API. It's under development, so if you want to contribute, fork me :)

CONTRIBUTION

        The library was written using Test Driven Development. If you want to 
    contribute, make shure your code pass on all tests and in the new tests that 
    you could create. 

        Read the DEPENDENCIES file to see wich test libs are used to validate 
    the code. 

        During the development, use the Makefile. Inside it, there are rules to 
    validate the python code with pep8 and pylint tools as well as test rules that
    will run tests for an especific module (artist, auth, etc).

        Create a file named secrets.py where you gonna put your session variable. It 
    will be used by the tests to run authenticated request: 
 
        # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
        mysession = "21c846aa7abf3c6fead46ae43d549dd0"
    
        If will be necessary to add new python libraries to the code, do not forget 
    to add it to requirements.txt file

        Enjoy coding \o/
